# ShareX Plugin for Flow Launcher

## Plugin working
All commands are based on ShareX HotkeyType Enum found on their [Github](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/ShareX/Enums.cs).

There is currently no setting panel. It is based on **default** [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/downloads) installation path.

## Manual installation
1) Open the solution with Visual Studio 2022.
2) Run a release build.
3) Copy the content of the ".\bin\Release\" folder.
4) Paste to "C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\FlowLauncher\Plugins\ShareX" folder.
